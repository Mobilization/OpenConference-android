# OpenConference

This repositoy offers an android app that can be used by any conference to display information like sessions, speaker etc. about the conference in a native android app

Originally this app has been build for droidcon Berlin, but the app can be styled and configured freely so that it can be used by other conferences as well.


# For your conference

The documentation is not available yet, but basically there are two ways to create your own android app for your conference (based on this source code):

1. Create a product flavor for your conference: Android's gradle plugin allows us to have multiple product flavors. If you use product flavors, you can benefit from some features like CI and testing. If you need help, please create an issue here on github.

2. Fork the whole repository and do your own thing.
